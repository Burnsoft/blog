<p>Back in November 2011 I started working on a new app that used the Notification Center in iOS 4+ to launch other apps and perform daily tasks (compose iMessage, Tweet, mail etc).</p>

<h4>iPrefs</h4>

<p>It started life as an app called &#8216;iPrefs&#8217; and the catalyst was the Settings URL scheme that became public knowledge at the iOS5 release. (e.g. prefs:root=AIRPLANE_MODE)</p>

<p>It made launching your settings easy, bluetooth was one swipe and a tap away, as was airplane mode. The app was fully localized in French, German, Italian and Spanish, would be free with one saved notification shortcut (in-app purchase for max of 10), worked great and a really nice looking app very similiar to the notification center.</p>

<p>Before I submitted to Apple for review I checked the Store for any other apps using the prefs URL scheme and found one other, so thought that the prefs URL&#8217;s were ok to use.
The app was uploaded on the 25th November, and rejected on the 2nd December.
&#8216;None public URL scheme&#8217; was the reason for rejection.
<em>(I had other bugs to fix, but on subsequent resolution center queries was made aware that under no circumstances could I use the prefs: urls. Even to help a user add a Twitter account when non was available in iOS5)</em></p>

<p>The original code for iPrefs is available on <a href="https://github.com/Burnsoft/Settings-Swipe/" title="Settings Swipe">Github</a>.</p>

<p>OK, fair enough. I understand that URL&#8217;s <strong><em>can</em></strong> change in the future, just move on I thought. So I did.</p>

<h4>App Swipe</h4>

<p>I still had this great use for Notification Center (I now know that I wasn&#8217;t alone, @drbarnard @artysx @skorebrits were all working on similiar apps around this time) and decided to use the NC functionality for iPrefs I had in mind as the basis for the new app.</p>

<p>If I couldn&#8217;t use settings, then I&#8217;ll use NC as a quick way to launch my favourite apps.</p>

<h5>Pre Xmas Opening</h5>

<p>I was cutting it fine for the Xmas closedown of iTunesConnect when I submitted App Swipe on the 9th December but I needn&#8217;t had worried.
By the 13th December I&#8217;d received my first ever &#8220;Your app requires additional review time&#8221; emails. Gutted!
There was nothing I could do except be very polite and ask via the resolution center if there was anything I could do.</p>

<p>Apple emailed me on the 21st December to discuss my app submission. The use  of notification center to create &#8216;quick links&#8217;referencing app review guidelines 2.4 was the main reason for my rejection.
I had also used an image that resembled the notification pull down screen as my app icon.
iTunesConnect was still showing my app as in review so I rejected the binary, removed the ability to use notification center for shortcuts and changed the offending images.</p>

<h5>Pre Xmas Shutdown Frenzy</h5>

<p>I re-submitted close to midnight on the 21st December, requested an expedited review, emailed the nice chap who I had spoken to earlier in the day and crossed my fingers. My expedited review was declined, which I understand as I didn&#8217;t have a major bug or anything that would cause a bad user experience. Lesson learned for expedited requests.</p>

<p>App Swipe stayed in review until 4th January until I received a very nice, &#8216;Your app App Swipe has been reviewed, but we are unable to post this version&#8217; email.
I&#8217;m unable to access the resolution center as this is now resolved but I had a good few pages or back and forth with the very helpful review team. (no sarcasm intended, just incase it comes across, honestly!).</p>

<h5>Its Groundhog day, again</h5>

<p>Rejected on the 11th January, rejected on the 17th January.
10.4 was now my nemesis.</p>

<p><strong><em>&#8216;Apps that create alternate desktop/home screen environments or simulate multi-app widget experiences will be rejected&#8217;.</em></strong></p>

<p>IMHO App Swipe was very similiar in functionality to other &#8216;launcher&#8217; apps on the store I now didn&#8217;t have a clue what I could do to the app to make it acceptable and pass review. <strong>So I appealed</strong>.
I don&#8217;t have the exact wording of the appeal as I didn&#8217;t save a copy, I&#8217;m pretty sure I didn&#8217;t beg or grovel, but I did make my case around the fact that any shortcut was placed explicitly by the user and not hard wired into the app. (man, I wish I&#8217;d kept a copy)</p>

<h5>Good Feeling</h5>

<p>My first bit of good news, positive appeal outcome came on the 20th December. This kickstarted the &#8216;move to live&#8217; process and App Swipe was available within 24 hours. <a href="https://twitter.com/AppSwipe/statuses/160153762537803776/" title="I'm live">App Swipe Twitter Status 20th Jan</a></p>

<h5>Future Updates</h5>

<p>App Swipe 1.2 has been awaiting review since the 11th February. At time of this article going live (17th Feb) I&#8217;m still waiting. Hopefull things will move this weekend.</p>

<p>I have more to say on my App Swipe experience, mainly around the inconsistant review process, URL Schemes, notification center.</p>

<p>Come back soon.</p>
