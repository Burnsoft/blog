<p>Back in November 2011 I started working on a new app that used the Notification Center in iOS 4+ to launch other apps and perform daily tasks (compose iMessage, Tweet, mail etc).</p>

<h4>iPrefs</h4>

<p>It started life as an app called &#8216;iPrefs&#8217; and the catalyst was the Settings URL scheme that became public knowledge at the iOS5 release. (e.g. prefs:root=AIRPLANE_MODE)</p>

<p><span class='has-pullquote' data-pullquote='bluetooth was one swipe and a tap away '>
It made launching your settings easy, bluetooth was one swipe and a tap away&#8221;, as was airplane mode. The app was fully localized in French, German, Italian and Spanish, would be free with one saved notification shortcut (in-app purchase for max of 10), worked great and a really nice looking app very similiar to the notification center.
</span></p>

<p>Before I submitted to Apple for review I checked the Store for any other apps using the prefs URL scheme and found one other, so thought that the prefs URL&#8217;s were ok to use.
The app was uploaded on the 25th November, and rejected on the 2nd December.
&#8216;None public URL scheme&#8217; was the reason for rejection.
<em>(I had other bugs to fix, but on subsequent resolution center queries was made aware that under no circumstances could I use the prefs: urls. Even to help a user add a Twitter account when non was available in iOS5)</em></p>

<p>OK, fair enough. I understand that URL&#8217;s <strong><em>can</em></strong> change in the future, just move on I thought. So I did.</p>

<p>The original code for iPrefs is available on Github</p>

<h4>App Swipe</h4>

<p>I still had this great use for Notification Center (I now know that I wasn&#8217;t alone, @drbarnard @artysx @skorebrits were all working on similiar apps around this time) and decided to use the NC functionality for iPrefs I had in mind as the basis for the new app.</p>
